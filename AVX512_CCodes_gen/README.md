# C-code-generators AVX512

This generator works only for pmns systems, whose external reduction polynomial is of the form $E(X) = X^n - X - 1$.

Next versions of this code generator will deal with the other external reduction polynomials soon.

In the Example.py file, we provide some parameter set for three systems used in the paper "A sfotware comparison between RNS and PMNS", for the moduli of size 807, 1214, and 1621 bits. The source codes generated will be the same as the ones in the reposit `pmns_phi52`.
